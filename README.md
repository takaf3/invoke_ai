# invoke_ai

A TypeScript-based command line tool that uses OpenRouter's API to get AI responses via streaming.

## Features

- üöÄ Stream AI responses in real-time
- üéØ Configurable AI models via environment variables
- üí¨ Custom system prompts support
- ‚ö° ZSH widget for natural language commands
- üì¶ Easy global installation via npm
- üîß No external HTTP dependencies - uses native fetch
- üîç Smart web search integration with automatic detection

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or higher
- tsx (will be installed automatically by the wrapper script)
- An OpenRouter API key (get one at https://openrouter.ai/)

## Setup

### 1. Get an OpenRouter API Key

Sign up at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) and get your API key.

### 2. Set Environment Variable

Add to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, etc.):
```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### 3. Install the Tool

#### Option 1: Install from GitHub (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/takaf3/invoke_ai.git
cd invoke_ai

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install globally
npm install -g .

# Now you can use 'ai' from anywhere
ai "What is the weather like?"
```

#### Option 2: Install directly from GitHub via npm
```bash
npm install -g git+https://github.com/takaf3/invoke_ai.git
```

#### Option 3: Local installation
```bash
cd /path/to/invoke_ai
npm install
./ai "Your prompt here"
```

## Usage

Basic usage:
```bash
ai "How do I list files sorted by size?"
```

With web search (automatically detected for queries needing current info):
```bash
ai "What's the latest news about AI?"
ai "What's the current stock price of AAPL?"
```

Force web search:
```bash
ai --search "Python documentation"
ai -s "Best practices for TypeScript"
```

Disable web search:
```bash
ai --no-search "What is the weather today?"
ai -n "Tell me about recent events"
```

The command will stream the AI's response directly to stdout.

## Configuration

Environment variables:
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (required): Your OpenRouter API key
- `AI_MODEL` (optional): The model to use (default: `openai/gpt-4.1-mini`)
- `AI_SYSTEM_PROMPT` (optional): System prompt to prepend to messages
- `AI_WEB_SEARCH_MAX_RESULTS` (optional): Max web search results (default: 5)
- `AI_VERBOSE` (optional): Set to `true` for debug logging

Example with custom model and system prompt:
```bash
export AI_MODEL="openai/gpt-4o"
export AI_SYSTEM_PROMPT="You are a helpful coding assistant."
ai "explain what a python decorator is"
```

## Web Search

The tool intelligently detects when web search would be helpful based on your query. It automatically enables web search for:

- Queries with temporal keywords: "latest", "recent", "current", "today", "news", "2024", "2025"
- Real-time information: "price", "stock", "weather", "score", "status", "live"
- Current events: "released", "announced", "trending", "happening", "breaking"

Web search is automatically disabled for:
- Simple greetings: "hi", "hello", "thanks"
- Code-related tasks: "help me write", "code", "implement", "fix", "debug"

You can always override the automatic detection:
- Use `--search` or `-s` to force web search
- Use `--no-search` or `-n` to disable web search

Web search costs $0.02 per request (5 results) and is powered by [Exa](https://exa.ai).

## ZSH Widget

A zsh widget is included that automatically intercepts any command starting with a capital letter and sends it to the AI tool.

**Prerequisites**: Make sure `ai` is installed globally first (see installation options above).

To enable the widget, add this to your `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
source /path/to/invoke_ai/ai-widget.zsh
```

After sourcing, you can simply type:
```bash
How do I list files in reverse order by modification time?
```

And it will automatically be converted to:
```bash
ai "How do I list files in reverse order by modification time?"
```

## Uninstall

To uninstall:
```bash
npm uninstall -g invoke-ai
```
